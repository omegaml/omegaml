# how to get from version => new version
# $ bumpversion <patch|build|release>
1.4.1 => 1.4.2-dev1 => 1.4.2-dev2 = > 1.4.2-rc1 => 1.4.2-rc2 => 1.4.2
         patch         build          release      build        release


Details
-------

Start with an initial release, say 1.4.1

1. create a new release, starting with a development build

   $ bumpversion patch
     => 1.4.2-dev1

2. every time you build

   $ bumpversion build
    => 1.4.2-dev2

3. go to release candidate

   $ bumpversion release
   => 1.4.2-rc1

4. with every new build

   $ bumpversion build
   => 1.4.2-rc2

4. release finally

   $ bumpversion release
   => 1.4.2

Note once the final release has been reached it is not possible to bump the release
before bumping patch again. Trying to bump the release while in final release state will
issue "ValueError: The part has already the maximum value among ['dev', 'rc', 'ga'] and cannot be bumped"
