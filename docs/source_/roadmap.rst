Product Roadmap
===============

This is a list of planned features

* virtual datasets - ability to store datasets that are in fact queries
  to other datasets 
* role-based permission model - ability to grant permissions on datasets,
  models and compute resources by roles (as opposed to the current
  single-key authorization)
