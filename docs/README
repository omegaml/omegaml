This sphinx project is setup to work as follows:

1. change to the virtualenv for omegaml 
2. cd docs
3. make livehtml

livehtml will monitor the source folder and automatically
rebuild the html pages whenever a new file is added or an
existing file changes.

So to edit and browse the results:

4. edit files in source/*.rst
5. open localhost:8000


How to build release documentation
----------------------------------

Build the current branch:

    $ make clean html


Build a live version of the current branch. This
re-builds the documentation whenever a file changes:

    $ make livehtml

Build multi-versioned document (see smv_* variables in conf.py for the versions):

    $ make multi-versioned


Create change log
-----------------

1. create a new git branch for the release, release/major.minor.patch[-rcN]
2. Add a draft release in github to generate release notes automatically
3. run scipts/mkchanges.ch --tags release/major.minor.patch[-rcN]

This will create a new file in docs/source/changes/release/v<major.minor.patch[-rcN]>.rst
