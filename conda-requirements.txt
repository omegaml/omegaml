# FIXME upgrade pip, caused error on django-allauth resolution
# due to https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#changes-to-the-pip-dependency-resolver-in-20-3-2020
# we use either pip 20.2.4 without --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver option
# or we use pip 20.3.1 with --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver option
# it is much easier to stick with 20.2.4 to keep legacy behavior than to instlal 20.3.1 and change all
# pip installations to use the legacy-resolver
# pip=20.2.4
# upgrading to pip 21.1.1 as in omegaml-ce
pip=21.1.1
# explicit need mysql support for Django
mysqlclient=2.0.3
